# Pandu River Cleaning Movement

My name is Balram, and I'm trying to clean up the Pandu River. The river starts off clean before reaching Kanpur, but unfortunately, it's severely polluted by the time it reaches the city. Let's raise awareness about these issues so that we can leave behind a clean river for our future generations.

According to a report by Reuters, more than 50% of the pollution in the entire Ganga river is caused by the Pandu River. The pollution mainly comes from three major sources in Kanpur:

1. **Leather factories** in Kanpur and Unnao, which generate a revenue of 6000 crores per year.
2. **Fly ash** from the Panki Power Plant.
3. **Sewage** discharged by the Kanpur Nagar Nigam.

A coal-based power plant situated along the Pandu River burns 600,000 tons of coal annually, producing 210,000 tons of fly ash. This ash is dumped into ponds, mixed with domestic wastewater, and then released into the Pandu River.
